                <div class="last-updated">📅 Updated 27 January 2026 · 14 furniture polishes tested on oak, pine, mahogany, and antiques</div>
                
                <p>Furniture polish seems simple — spray, wipe, shine. But the wrong product can leave greasy buildup, attract more dust, or even damage antique finishes. The right one protects wood, enhances grain, and makes dusting easier for weeks.</p>
                
                <p>We tested 14 polishes on different wood types and finishes. <strong>The best furniture polishes nourish wood and leave a protective layer</strong> — the worst just create a sticky film that collects dust.</p>
                
                <div class="quick-picks">
                    <h3>The Quick Answer</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best overall:</strong> Pledge Multi-Surface — versatile, dust-repelling, classic</li>
                        <li><strong>Best for real wood:</strong> Furniture Clinic Wood Polish — nourishes and protects</li>
                        <li><strong>Best for antiques:</strong> Antiquax Original Wax — traditional formula, museum-trusted</li>
                        <li><strong>Best eco:</strong> Method Wood for Good — plant-based, almond scent</li>
                        <li><strong>Best budget:</strong> Mr Sheen Multi-Surface — cheap and cheerful</li>

                    <h3>Polish vs Wax vs Oil: What's the Difference?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Polish (spray):</strong> Quick shine and dust protection. Good for regular maintenance on modern furniture. Contains silicones that create a protective layer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Wax:</strong> Traditional finish that soaks into wood. Better protection, richer finish, but more effort. Best for antiques and quality pieces.</p>
                    <p><strong>Oil:</strong> Penetrates and nourishes bare or oiled wood (not varnished). For teak, oak, and unsealed wood furniture.</p>

                    <p>Pledge has been the UK's favourite furniture polish since the 1950s, and there's a reason it's still everywhere. The formula leaves a genuine shine, repels dust for days, and works on wood, laminate, leather, stainless steel, and more.</p>
                    
                    <p>The "Enhancing" variant adds more shine; "Classic" is the original formula. Both work brilliantly for regular maintenance on modern furniture. That distinctive lemon-fresh scent is a bonus.</p>

                    <p>When you have proper wooden furniture — not veneer or laminate — you want something that actually nourishes the wood, not just makes it shiny. Furniture Clinic's polish contains natural waxes and oils that condition wood while protecting the surface.</p>
                    
                    <p>It brings out grain beautifully, especially on oak and mahogany. More expensive than spray polishes, but the difference on quality furniture is obvious. A little goes a long way.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Can furniture polish damage wood?</h4>
                        <p>Modern spray polishes contain silicones that can build up over time, making wood look cloudy. This is mainly a concern for antiques. For everyday furniture, the buildup takes years and can be removed with a wood cleaner if needed.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>How often should I polish furniture?</h4>
                        <p>Dust weekly with a dry or slightly damp cloth. Polish monthly for regular furniture, or every 2-3 months for wax-finished pieces. Over-polishing causes buildup.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Can I use furniture polish on kitchen cabinets?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, spray polish works fine on most kitchen cabinets. For heavy grease, use a <a href="/kitchen-cleaners.html">kitchen degreaser</a> first, then polish. Avoid polish on cabinets near the hob — it can become sticky with cooking residue.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>What about homemade polish?</h4>
                        <p>Olive oil and lemon juice is a popular DIY recipe. It works short-term but can go rancid and attract dust. For occasional use it's fine; for regular care, proper polish is more reliable.</p>
