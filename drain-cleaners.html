                <div class="last-updated">📅 Updated 27 January 2026 · 12 drain cleaners tested on real blockages</div>
                
                <p>A blocked drain is one of the most frustrating household problems — standing in a filling shower or watching the kitchen sink refuse to empty. The good news: most blockages can be cleared without calling a plumber. The bad news: many drain cleaners are surprisingly ineffective.</p>
                
                <p>We tested 12 products on hair clogs, grease blockages, and general slow drains. <strong>The best drain cleaners dissolve organic matter quickly</strong> — the worst just mask the problem temporarily.</p>
                
                <div class="quick-picks">
                    <h3>The Quick Answer</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best overall:</strong> Mr Muscle Sink & Drain Gel — powerful, fast-acting, reliable</li>
                        <li><strong>Best for hair:</strong> HG Hair Unblocker — specifically dissolves hair blockages</li>
                        <li><strong>Best prevention:</strong> Buster Enzyme Drain Maintainer — monthly use prevents clogs</li>
                        <li><strong>Best eco:</strong> Ecover Drain Unblocker — plant-based enzymes, gentler formula</li>
                        <li><strong>Best budget:</strong> Own-brand caustic soda — cheap and brutal (use carefully)</li>

                    <h3>⚠️ Safety First</h3>
                    <p>Drain cleaners contain powerful chemicals. Always:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Never mix products</strong> — especially bleach with other cleaners (toxic fumes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Wear gloves</strong> — chemical burns are no joke</li>
                        <li><strong>Ventilate the room</strong> — open windows when using</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep away from children and pets</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Don't use in toilets</strong> unless specifically designed for them</li>

                    <p>Mr Muscle has been the UK's go-to drain cleaner for years, and the gel formula is their best. It sinks through standing water to reach the blockage, then dissolves grease, hair, and soap scum. Most blockages clear within 15 minutes.</p>
                    
                    <p>The gel consistency is key — it clings to pipe walls rather than just running through, giving the chemicals time to work on buildup you can't even see.</p>

                    <p>It won't clear an existing blockage, but regular use means you'll rarely need the heavy-duty stuff. Much gentler on pipes than caustic cleaners.</p>

                    <p>Most drain cleaners are environmental nightmares — Ecover proves you can shift blockages without pouring caustic chemicals into the water system. Their plant-based enzyme formula works on hair, grease, and soap scum, just more slowly than chemical options.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's best for slow drains rather than complete blockages. Leave overnight for best results. Safe for septic tanks.</p>

                    <p>This is the nuclear option. Caustic soda (lye) is what the heavy-duty commercial drain cleaners are based on — you're just buying it without the branding markup. It dissolves organic matter aggressively and clears serious blockages.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>But it's dangerous.</strong> It generates heat, can splash, causes chemical burns, and damages skin and eyes on contact. Only use if you're comfortable handling harsh chemicals with proper protection.</p>

                        <h4>Can drain cleaner damage pipes?</h4>
                        <p>With occasional use, modern drain cleaners are safe for most pipes. However, frequent use of caustic cleaners can damage older pipes, especially PVC. Enzyme-based cleaners are safest for regular maintenance.</p>

                        <h4>Why didn't the drain cleaner work?</h4>
                        <p>Chemical cleaners dissolve organic matter (hair, grease, soap). They won't work on: solid objects (toys, caps), mineral buildup, or blockages deep in the main sewer line. For these, you need a plumber.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Is it safe to use drain cleaner in a garbage disposal?</h4>
                        <p>Most are safe, but check the label. Never pour caustic soda into a disposal — it can damage the mechanism. For disposals, enzyme cleaners or specific disposal cleaning products are safer.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>How often should I clean my drains?</h4>
                        <p>Monthly enzyme treatment prevents most blockages. Don't use caustic cleaners preventatively — they're for existing blockages only. Regular hot water flushes help too.</p>
