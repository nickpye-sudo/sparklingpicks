### Post 1: Laundry Detergent Guide
**Title:** After testing 14 laundry detergents over 200+ washes, here's what I'd actually buy (UK)

**Body:**
My wife made me test detergents after I ruined her favourite white shirt with my "cheapest on the shelf" approach. Three months later, here's what I learned:

**Quick picks:**
- **Best overall:** Persil Bio — handles everything, ~12p/wash in bulk
- **Tough stains:** Ariel Original — unbeaten on grass and oil  
- **Sensitive skin:** Surcare — actually gentle, dermatologist approved
- **Budget winner:** Lidl Formil — 6p per wash, surprisingly good
- **Eco pick:** Ecover Non-Bio — plant-based that actually cleans

**Biggest surprise:** Some expensive brands barely beat Aldi's £2 bottle. Price ≠ performance.

**Bio vs Non-Bio:** Bio has enzymes for protein stains (food, blood, grass). Non-bio is gentler for babies/eczema. Start with bio, switch only if you get irritation.

### Post 2: Bathroom Cleaning Hacks
**Title:** Tested bathroom cleaners for 3 months - limescale edition (UK hard water area)

**Body:**
Living in a hard water area means the limescale battle is real. Tested a bunch of bathroom cleaners specifically for limescale removal.

**What actually works:**
- **HG Professional Limescale Remover** — Nuclear option. Dissolves years of buildup. Use gloves.
- **Viakal** — Good daily maintenance, prevents buildup
- **Cillit Bang Limescale** — Decent but overhyped
- **White vinegar** — Works but you need to leave it for ages

**Pro tip:** For shower screens, squeegee after every use. Prevents 90% of limescale building up in the first place.

**Skip:** Most "bathroom cleaners" are just surface cleaners with limescale claims. Read the active ingredients.

### Post 3: Budget Cleaning Products
**Title:** Which supermarket own-brand cleaning products are actually good? (UK)

**Body:**
Tested Aldi, Lidl, Tesco, and Sainsbury's own brands against name brands. Some surprises:

**Worth buying:**
- Lidl Formil laundry liquid — genuinely good, 6p/wash
- Aldi dishwasher tablets — near-identical to Finish
- Tesco toilet cleaner — same job, half the price

**Stick with name brand:**
- Oven cleaners — Mr Muscle just works better
- Drain unblockers — don't mess around, get Mr Muscle or HG
- Mould removers — HG Mould Spray is worth the premium

**The pattern:** Simple products (surface cleaners, toilet cleaners) — own brand is fine. Specialised jobs (oven, drains, mould) — pay for the good stuff.

### Post 4: Eco Cleaning Products
**Title:** "Eco-friendly" cleaning products - which ones actually work? (UK, tested)

**Body:**
Wanted to switch to eco products but was skeptical. Tested the main brands for 2 months.

**Actually work:**
- **Ecover washing up liquid** — Great, lasts ages
- **Smol laundry pods** — Subscription model, genuinely effective
- **Method surface cleaner** — Smells amazing, cleans well

**Don't bother:**
- Most "eco" dishwasher tablets — struggled with baked-on food
- Cheap eco toilet cleaners — might as well use water

**Reality check:** Eco products are usually 20-30% more expensive. Some are worth it, some aren't. The marketing is stronger than the cleaning power in many cases.
