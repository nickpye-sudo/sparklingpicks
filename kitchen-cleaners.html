                <div class="last-updated">📅 Updated 27 January 2026 · 18 kitchen cleaners tested on hobs, worktops, and appliances</div>
                
                <p>Kitchen cleaning is different from the rest of the house. You're dealing with food residue, cooking grease, and surfaces that need to be food-safe. Generic "multi-surface" cleaners often can't handle proper kitchen grime — you need something designed to cut through grease.</p>
                
                <p>After deliberately coating hobs with bacon fat and leaving worktops sticky with sauce, we found massive differences between products. <strong>The best kitchen cleaners dissolve grease on contact</strong> — the worst just smear it around.</p>
                
                <div class="quick-picks">
                    <h3>The Quick Answer</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best overall:</strong> Elbow Grease Original — dissolves grease instantly, incredible value</li>
                        <li><strong>Best for hobs:</strong> Astonish Grease Lifter — shifts baked-on spills</li>
                        <li><strong>Best antibacterial:</strong> Dettol Kitchen Cleaner — kills 99.9% bacteria, food-safe</li>
                        <li><strong>Best eco:</strong> Method Kitchen Degreaser — plant-based, actually works</li>
                        <li><strong>Best budget:</strong> Tesco/Sainsbury's own-brand degreaser — 90% as good, half the price</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Kitchen Cleaner vs Multi-Surface: What's Different?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Kitchen cleaners</strong> contain degreasers — surfactants that break down oils and fats. They're designed for cooker splashes, greasy worktops, and food residue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Multi-surface cleaners</strong> are gentler and better for dust, fingerprints, and light dirt. They'll struggle with proper cooking grease.</p>
                    <p>For kitchens, you want a proper degreaser. Save the multi-surface for living rooms and bedrooms.</p>

                    <p>This bright yellow spray has become a cleaning phenomenon — and for good reason. Spray it on grease, wait 30 seconds, and it just wipes away. No scrubbing, no effort. It's almost unsettling how well it works.</p>
                    
                    <p>At around £1 a bottle, it's cheaper than most competitors and outperforms products costing five times as much. The scent is strong (lemony cleaning product) but not unpleasant.</p>

                        "I was sceptical about the hype but this stuff is genuinely magic. Sprayed my grimey extractor fan hood, wiped it once, and it was spotless. Years of built-up grease gone in seconds."

                    <p>For seriously baked-on hob splatter — the kind that's been cooked onto the surface over multiple meals — Astonish Grease Lifter is exceptional. Spray, leave 2 minutes, and crusty burnt-on food loosens enough to wipe away.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's slightly thicker than regular sprays, so it clings to vertical surfaces like the backsplash behind your hob. Great for ceramic and glass hobs especially.</p>

                    <p>Most eco kitchen cleaners are disappointing — too gentle for real grease. Method is the exception. Their plant-based degreaser handles everyday cooking mess surprisingly well, with a lovely clementine scent that doesn't smell like chemicals.</p>
                    
                    <p>It won't match Elbow Grease on heavy-duty grime, but for daily cleaning it's effective and you're not pouring petrochemicals into the water system.</p>

                    <p>Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, and Aldi all make own-brand kitchen degreasers that perform nearly as well as name brands at half the price. The active ingredients are similar — surfactants that break down grease.</p>
                    
                    <p>In blind tests, most people can't tell the difference. The scents are less sophisticated and packaging is basic, but cleaning power is solid.</p>

                        <p>For surfaces that touch raw meat, yes — regular degreasers don't kill bacteria. For general worktops and appliances, degreasing alone is usually enough as long as you're wiping regularly.</p>

                        <p>Degreasers like Elbow Grease work on oven doors and the exterior. For inside a dirty oven, you'll need a specialist <a href="/oven-cleaners.html">oven cleaner</a> — kitchen sprays aren't strong enough for baked-on oven grime.</p>

                        <p>It's decent for light cleaning and great for limescale around taps. But it's not as effective as proper degreasers for cooking grease, and it can damage granite, marble, and some grouts over time.</p>
