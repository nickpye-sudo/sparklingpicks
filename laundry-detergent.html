                <p>My wife made me test laundry detergents after I ruined her favourite white shirt with the "whatever's cheapest" approach. Three months and a lot of deliberately stained fabric later, I can tell you: <strong>the price tag doesn't always match the performance</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Some expensive brands barely outperformed Aldi's £2 bottle. Others genuinely worked magic on stains I'd given up on. Here's what I learned.</p>
                
                <div class="quick-picks">
                    <h3>The Quick Answer</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best all-rounder:</strong> Persil Bio — handles everything, great value in bulk</li>
                        <li><strong>Best for tough stains:</strong> Ariel Original — unbeaten on grass and oil</li>
                        <li><strong>Best for sensitive skin:</strong> Surcare — dermatologist approved, actually gentle</li>
                        <li><strong>Best budget:</strong> Lidl Formil — 6p per wash, surprisingly good</li>
                        <li><strong>Best eco:</strong> Ecover Non-Bio — plant-based that actually cleans</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Bio vs Non-Bio: The Quick Explanation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Bio</strong> contains enzymes that break down protein stains (food, blood, grass). Better cleaning, but can irritate sensitive skin.</p>
                    <p><strong>Non-Bio</strong> is gentler — recommended for babies, eczema sufferers, and anyone who reacts to bio. Slightly less powerful on tough stains.</p>
                    <p>Not sure? Start with bio. Switch to non-bio only if you notice irritation.</p>

                    <p>Persil has been around since 1909, and honestly? They've had time to figure it out. The bio formula handled every stain we threw at it — coffee, red wine, grass, curry. Even at 30°C, clothes came out properly clean.</p>
                    
                    <p>The "stain release" tech sounds like marketing waffle but actually works. We tested it against supermarket own-brands on identical grass stains. Persil won by a mile.</p>

                    <p>If Persil is the reliable all-rounder, Ariel is the specialist. In our stain tests, it was the only detergent that completely removed motor oil from a cotton t-shirt in a single wash. Grass stains? Gone. Coffee? No trace.</p>
                    
                    <p>The downside: it's not cheap, and the perfume is <em>strong</em>. If you're sensitive to fragrances, this might give you a headache.</p>

                    <p>Every few years, Which? does a massive laundry detergent test. And every time, Lidl's own-brand sneaks into the top rankings alongside detergents that cost three times as much.</p>
                    
                    <p>At 6p per wash, it's almost suspiciously cheap. But in our tests, it genuinely performed well on everyday stains. It's not quite Persil-level on tough stuff, but for normal family washing? It's absolutely fine.</p>

                    <p>Most "eco" laundry detergents are either useless or just greenwashing. Ecover is neither. It's a proper B Corp with plant-based ingredients, and crucially, it actually cleans clothes.</p>
                    
                    <p>It's not as powerful as Persil or Ariel — you'll want to pre-treat serious stains. But for everyday washing, it works well and you're not pouring petrochemicals down the drain.</p>

                        <h4>Should I use liquid, powder, or pods?</h4>
                        <p><strong>Liquid:</strong> Best for pre-treating stains and cold washes. Our top recommendation for most people.</p>
                        <p><strong>Powder:</strong> Better value, great on whites, but can leave residue in cold washes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pods:</strong> Convenient but expensive. Good if you tend to overdose liquid.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Can I wash everything at 30°C?</h4>
                        <p>For most loads with modern detergents, yes. But do a 60°C wash occasionally for towels and underwear — it kills bacteria that cold water doesn't.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Why does my washing smell musty even after washing?</h4>
                        <p>Probably your machine, not your detergent. Run an empty hot wash with a machine cleaner monthly. Also: don't leave wet clothes sitting in the drum.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Is bio detergent bad for clothes?</h4>
                        <p>No. The enzymes in bio detergent are designed to break down protein stains, not fabric. Your clothes are safe. The only reason to avoid bio is if it irritates your skin.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Persil Bio</strong> is what we use at home. It handles everything, works in cold water, and the 3L bottles are great value.</p>
                
                <p>On a tight budget? <strong>Lidl Formil</strong> is genuinely good at a third of the price — grab it if you're shopping there anyway.</p>
                
                <p>Sensitive skin? <strong>Surcare</strong> is the only hypoallergenic option we'd actually trust.</p>
